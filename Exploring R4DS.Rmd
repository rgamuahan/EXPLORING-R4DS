 # Introduction
  
  The **sun** is not ***shining***. We are having **classes** and it is noisy outside. However, the students are very eager to learn.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data(diamonds)
head(diamonds)
```

library(tidyverse)
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = class))
