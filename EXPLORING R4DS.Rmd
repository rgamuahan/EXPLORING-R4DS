# Introduction

The **sun** is not ***shining***. We are having **classes** and it is noisy outside. However, the students are very eager to learn. 

### Continuation

The noise continues.

To install a package, use the following code: `install.packages("tidyverse")`

# ***Exploring Diamonds Dataset***

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data(diamonds)
head(diamonds)
```
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = class))

library(tidyverse)
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
